# covid-o-grapher
COVID-19 Tracking and Graphing tool

"The Covid-O-Grapher" tracks COVID-19 statistics of regions in the past 90 days and graphs it on a line graph using the disease.sh open source API.

"The covid-o-grapher" is a project made by Rishaan.

I wanted to make a project related to COVID-19 in some way and I wanted to learn React.js as well, so I decided to 'kill Two Birds with One Stone' and make "the covid-o-grapher." I hope this is useful to anyone who uses it.


This is in its initial version and here are some of features I wish to add to it.
- A Timeline Selector.
- Better formatting on Mobile
- Better Loading Times for the Graph.
- A table or cards showing the statistics above the graph.
